## Inspiration
As cannabis has been nationally legalized here in Canada, we are coming to better understand the effects of cannabis on our brains. With sites like Leafly and others, people are documenting how different strains make them feel and how this might correlate to the flavour. The flavour strongly correlates to the terpenes in a specific strain, and very little research currently exists about how terpenes affect the feelings on consuming cannabis. Right now, only major cannabinoids (THC and CBD) are documented and often recreational users seek large contents of THC. However, other factors like terpenes play a large role that we don't understand yet. Mre research into the effects could help in seeking better customized treatment for medical usage and more options for recreational users.

## What it does
Two graphs exploring the effects and flavours (terpene related) of different cannabis strains and what is most common.
